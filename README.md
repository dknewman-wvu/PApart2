# SENG Programming Assignment Part 2


"Borrowed" library from https://github.com/kms0079/seng560-Assignment1/blob/master/arithmeticLibrary/src/main/ArithmeticFunctions.java

My app is written in C# .net core 3.0

- Simple consoloe app that uses hard coded variables to make the calculations
- Java library that I "borrowed" is in the BorrowedMath.CS
- Program.cs is where you will find the main class.

The library was really easy to use as Java and C# are very similar in syntax, just had to fix a couple capitalizations.
Outside of one or two syntax changes there were no changes.

The library works well, as you can see when you run then console application.
